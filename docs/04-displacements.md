# Calculate the displacements / SSD values. 

Either run:

```
ImageAnalysis('file name', ‘disp’)
```
Or set the switch in manytimes to ‘disp’ and run. The output files are called ‘experiment \_position\_change.txt’ and ‘experiment\_SSD.mat’. 

The ‘experiment\_position\_change.txt’ is the output for the **prior algorithm** discussed in the manuscript describing this method.

The ‘experiment\_SSD.mat’ is the output for the **refined algorithm** discussed in the manuscript describing this method.
