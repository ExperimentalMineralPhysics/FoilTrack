# FoilTrack

This suite of Matlab scripts has been created for analysing displacement of features within X-radiographs acquired during Large Volume Press (D-DIA, DT-Cup, etc.) experiments at Synchrotron facilities. The scripts track the position of selected regions or boxes in the images by finding the minimum of the Sum Squared Differences (SSD) between pairs of images in a series. The scripts are able to process most common file formats. 

Documentation, such as it is, for the scripts are in the File ImageAnalysisSuiteDocumentation.docx. 

The suite of scripts has been tested under:

	Ubuntu 14.04 / Matlab 2014a
	
	MacOS 10.13 (High Siera) / MatLab 2017a
	

*N.B.:*

1. This is reseach software not written for public consumption. The many bugs are all mine. If you find any please let me know. 

2. Some parts of the scripts require Matlab toolboxes. However when dumping the package to GitHub I have not checked what toolboxes are used and where. 

3. The documentation is far from complete. It was written as aide-m√©moire for when I use the scripts.
